{"name":"E28 tacho enhancement","tagline":"","body":"### BMW E28 Tacho Enhancement\r\nHey folks, \r\n\r\nin the middle of my [BMW E28 turbo build project](http://www.bmw-syndikat.de/bmwsyndikatfotos/topic41254_E28_535i_vom_haesslichen_Entlein_zum_stolzen_Schwan_Fotostories_weiterer_BMW_Modelle.html) I am struggling a with the idea how to display some important informations about the engine.\r\n\r\nI am planning to use a free programmable [ViPec V88](http://www.vi-pec.com/ecus/v88) ECU. The advantage is, that I can get all the informations, which the ECU get's via CAN Bus.\r\n\r\nTherefore I am planning to use a [SaintSmart Mega 2560 Controller Board - or similar Arduino](http://www.sainsmart.com/sainsmart-mega2560-development-board-for-arduino.html) to read all the Infos from CAN Bus via a [CAN Bus Shield](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/CAN-BUS_Shield) wich is attached to the Controller Board. In the ECU Programming Tool, I can free decide which data to send. \r\n\r\nMaybe if you guys are planning to also modify your cockpit cluster, this will be the difference, where the data is coming from.\r\n\r\n## Wishlist\r\n\r\n* Change ServiceIntervall Gauge to RPM Depending ShiftLight [Example Idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwnEp0i-FA0)\r\n* Use CheckControll Light to display general Warning which are send via the ECU\r\n* Switch functionality of the economy Gauge to boost pressure [Example Idea](http://www.e30tech.com/forum/showthread.php?t=117682)\r\n\r\nThis is how it should look like\r\n![e28 kombi](images/e28-kombi.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Check Control Light Control via Arduino/SaintSmart\r\nThis is the easiest part of conversion. I read the electric documentation about the instrument cluster.\r\nI found out, that the check control lamp is mass controlled. So, I just need to figure out the mass control line and hook into.\r\n\r\n### Service Intervall LED's used as RPM depending Shift Light\r\nTo make this happen, I will cut the connection from the LED's to the service interval micro processor.\r\nThen I need to use a 12 bit shift register chip, otherwise I need to use 9 outputs of my controller board.\r\nIf found some ideas how to do this here [Arduino 8 bit shift register to controll 7 leds](http://blog.rastating.com/using-a-74hc595-shift-register-with-an-arduino-uno/).\r\n\r\nStay tuned, new stuff is coming soon.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nSourcecode, Contributors and Help?
